The release version of CODEnator 1.0 contains the afore-documented aspects and functionalities.
 
 
(i) `WHAT THE PROJECT DOES` - 
CODEnator is a tool that is capable of converting a user defined, User Interface Layout (UI Layout) to manipulatable client-side code.
Simple websites are accurately generated, while the code snippets for individual modules, i.e. 
the detected UI elements like headers, buttons etc. are also generated for the user to access at his discretion.

ðŸŽ¯ ``PRODUCT``
â€¢	CODEnator exploits computer vision algorithms and image processing techniques provided by the OpenCV library of Python, that operate on a user-specified UI layout image.
â€¢	The extracted UI elements are converted into tags, which can be modified as per the user's discretion.

(ii)``TARGET CONSUMER BASE``  - 
â€¢	Any public or private, small-scale organization looking to establish or expand their online presence can use CODEnator and obtain aesthetically pleasing UI designs and layouts.
â€¢	UI developers can use CODEnator as a simulation and verification tool to meet their design requirements. 
â€¢	Entrepreneurs can utilize CODEnator to create a starter framework that felicitates their needs.
